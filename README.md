# Singly-Linked-List

Using C++, create a class for linked list, which nodes concern of studentsâ€™ record that contain student id, name and CGPA. The linked list should maintain a head pointer, which points to the first node in the linked list, and the size (int) of the linked list. Size should increase each time insert node operation is successful, and decrease each time delete node operation is successful.

Define the following functions in the class:
i) Create node
ii) Insert front
iii) Insert middle or end
iv) Delete front
v) Delete middle or end
vi) Display list

Create a driver program to demonstrate the linked list operations by creating a class list and display
the following:
i) Average CGPA
ii) Highest CGPA student record
iii) Lowest CGPA student record
iv) All students with CGPA less than 2.00 (probation)
v) All students with CGPA bigger than or equal to 3.50 (dean list)
